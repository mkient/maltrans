Residual malaria transmission remains a major public health challenge in Burkina Faso, West Africa, despite the implementation of high coverage control interventions. This phenomenon is characterised by the persistence of Plasmodium infections in the population, which can undermine malaria elimination efforts. Recent studies have highlighted the magnitude of residual malaria transmission in Burkina Faso, indicating that a significant number of individuals continue to harbour Plasmodium infections even when preventive measures are in place. For example, this study published in Acta Tropica reports that despite high coverage with interventions such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), malaria transmission persists in certain villages, suggesting that these interventions alone may not be sufficient to eliminate the disease.
